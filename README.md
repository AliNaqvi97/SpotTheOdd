# SpotTheOdd
Source Code for my second Android app: Spot The Odd

I wrote this near the beginning of 2016 as a second app, mostly playing around with
new concepts I learned and a game idea inspired by popular eye test/color vision games.
Not actively updating it (besides to clean up/improve code as I have learned more since
then) so it is not a WIP as far as new features/big updates and such.
